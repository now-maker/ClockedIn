    <h2>Structured Programs That Actually Work</h2>
    <p>
      ClockedIn offers structured 4-week and 8-week programs.
      Content unlocks weekly to prevent overwhelm and encourage consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progress is measured through your daily inputs — not motivation alone.
      At the end of every week, we review your data together and refine your approach.

  <!-- WHY -->
  <section class="about">
    <h2>Why ClockedIn Is Different</h2>
    <p>
      Most productivity advice fails because there’s no accountability.
      ClockedIn combines systems, data, and human feedback —
      so improvement becomes inevitable, not optional.
